  <h1>Challenge Your Memory!</h1>

  <div id="start-game-container" class="container">
    <p>Pair the images on the cards in this memory game. Fun brain training for both children and adults!</p>
    
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>On the game board, there are always two identical images. Start the game by flipping a card. Then try to find another card that has the same image as the first. If you can't find a pair, the flipped cards will be flipped back with the face down. Try to remember these images as it becomes easier to find pairs the longer you play. When you find a pair they are removed from the board. Match all pairs to finish the game!</p>
